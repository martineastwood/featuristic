[Featuristic](https://www.featuristic.co.uk/) uses Genetic Algorithms to automate the process of **feature engineering** and **feature selection**, enhancing the performance of machine learning models by optimizing their predictive capabilities.

See the [documentation](https://www.featuristic.co.uk/) for more detailed information.

## Understanding Genetic Feature Synthesis

Featuristic uses symbolic regression to intelligently derive interpretable mathematical formulas, which are then used to create new features from your dataset.

Initially, Featuristic creates a diverse population of formulas using fundamental mathematical operators such as `add`, `subtract`, `sin`, `tan`, `square`, `sqrt`, and more.

For instance, a formula generated by Featuristic might look like this: `(square(feature_1) - abs(feature_2)) * feature_3`.

Next, Featuristic assesses the efficacy of these formulas by quanifying how effectively the features correlate with the target variable. Those formulas yielding features with the strongest correlations are then selected and recombined using a genetic algorithm to produce offspring, as illustrated below.

These offspring may also undergo point mutations, which causes alterations to random operators within the formula. This process introduces slight variations to the formulas, enhancing the diversity of the population and potentially leading to the discovery of novel and more effective feature representations.

This iterative process continues across multiple generations, continually refining the population of formulas with the goal of generating features that exhibit strong correlations with the target variable.
