    "# 🧰 Genetic Feature Selector\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GeneticFeatureSelector` class performs **feature selection** using binary genetic evolution. It searches for the optimal subset of features that **minimizes a user-defined objective function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful alternative to wrapper-based or greedy feature selection techniques like RFE or SelectKBest - especially useful when feature interactions and nonlinearity matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each candidate solution (called a genome) is a binary vector where each bit represents a feature.\n",
    "2. A value of 1 means the feature is selected; 0 means it’s excluded.\n",
    "3. Each genome is evaluated by a custom objective function, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def objective(X, y):\n",
    "    model = Ridge().fit(X, y)\n",
    "    return mean_squared_error(y, model.predict(X))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The best-scoring individuals evolve over generations using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tournament selection\n",
    "- Crossover\n",
    "- Mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After convergence, the best subset of features is returned.\n",

    "- Your objective_function can use any estimator, cross-validation, or scoring logic.\n",

    "- Set `early_termination_iters` to avoid long-running searches when the solution plateaus."
